# First Post

Beep beep. _Is this thing on?_  This website uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and Lukas Himsel's [lightweight blog theme](https://github.com/lukas-h/material-theme/), largely unmodified. The only change so far to the theme is adding an icon for LinkedIn, removing the 'projects' section temporarily, and removing the impression/license page.

My plan for this blog is two-fold. First, this is a place to share news, links, and random tid-bits that interest me. Second, this is a place to document and organize my thoughts on new tech-related things I am learning.
